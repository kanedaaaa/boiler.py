# Boiler

Boiler is an interactive CLI app written in Python. It's main purpose is to generate
"boilerplates" for me. I know there are some alternatives, but none of them matches
what i want. 

I.e option "node.js" will generate javascript folder with `src`, `package.json` scripts,
`index.js` as an entry point. Typescript will setup `ts-node` or `tsc` stuff, write 
`tsconfig.json`, some deps for testing, etc. You get the point. 

It's for my preferences only. And yes, despite fact that this is written mainly for 
javascript ecosystem, i chose to write it in Python because i kinda like Python. It's
cool, in its own way ;/
